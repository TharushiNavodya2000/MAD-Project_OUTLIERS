## Project Description 
<img src="wave.gif" alt="wave hand" width="40px" height ="40px" align="center"> Hello,This is Outliers Travel management Mobile application.<br/> Mobile applications related to travel management are used by many people today to plan their travel very efficiently and reliably in the face of the busyness of people nowadays. The same process is done through the application that we create, where in addition to this, there are several additional functionalities related to the travel plan that are not commonly seen in such software. This mobile application gives the opportunity to make notes about the areas where different people have traveled. The specialty of this is that you can get opinions on many areas such as the place you hope to travel to and other places to visit nearby, tourist resorts, transportation facilities, food and beverage facilities etc. Also, they can plan their travel time, amount of money, etc., and with that, these users can manage their time and money.</p> <p>compare other similar kind of application special features present here are grate UI/UX design, using dynamic function (GPS, Google map etc.) to attract users, fast performance and fast loading, all data store cloud base, improved security (biometric authentication, all functions users can use without charging any fee, extra validation method) and use simple design so no need to by hard anything etc.</p>

### Methodology
Requirement Engineering methods 
In the creation of this software, we used several commonly used software related to travel management and studied their existing similarities and differences as well as their existing practices, user feedback, etc.

#### Design method
Based on the knowledge and creativity gained from the studied applications, before proceeding to the implementation phase, we used Figma prototype tool to design the application well.

#### Development Tools and Technologies
•	IDE – Android Studio <br/>
•	Programming language – Java <br/>
•	Database – Firebase <br/>
•	Platform – Android <br/>
#### Testing Methods 
Use different test case and identify the issues in our application 
#### Integration Methods
GitHub will be our go-to option as we are provided with free access to all features with our student accounts.
